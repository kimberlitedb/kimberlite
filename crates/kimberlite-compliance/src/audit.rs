//! Enhanced Audit Logging for Compliance Operations
//!
//! Implements comprehensive audit event tracking satisfying:
//! - **SOC 2 CC7.2** - Change Detection (monitoring and logging of all changes)
//! - **ISO 27001 A.12.4.1** - Event Logging (recording user activities, exceptions, faults)
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! ComplianceAuditLog = {
//!     events: Vec<ComplianceAuditEvent>,   // Append-only, immutable
//!     append(action, actor, tenant) -> Uuid,
//!     query(filter) -> Vec<&Event>,
//!     export_json(filter) -> String,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The audit log is append-only: events cannot be modified or deleted after
//! insertion. This guarantees `AuditLogImmutability` -- a core compliance
//! property proven in the TLA+ meta-framework.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use kimberlite_compliance::audit::{ComplianceAuditLog, ComplianceAuditAction, AuditQuery};
//! use uuid::Uuid;
//!
//! let mut log = ComplianceAuditLog::new();
//!
//! // Record a consent event
//! let event_id = log.append(
//!     ComplianceAuditAction::ConsentGranted {
//!         subject_id: "user@example.com".into(),
//!         purpose: "Marketing".into(),
//!         scope: "ContactInfo".into(),
//!     },
//!     Some("admin".into()),
//!     Some(1),
//! );
//!
//! // Query by subject
//! let query = AuditQuery::default().with_subject("user@example.com");
//! let results = log.query(&query);
//! assert_eq!(results.len(), 1);
//! ```
