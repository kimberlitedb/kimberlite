SemVer policy and deprecation windows.

Internal audit trails and design campaigns live under
[`docs-internal/`](./docs-internal/) and are not duplicated here. The
git log is the authoritative per-commit record; this file is the
user-facing narrative.

## [Unreleased]

_Accretion slot for v0.8.0 work. See [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md#v080--in-flight)
for the planned scope._

The first wave of v0.8.0 PRs is the notebar v0.7.0-migration wishlist —
six items that surfaced once notebar drove a real workload on top of the
v0.7.0 release. Each ships behind its own PR and lands when reviewed; the
order below tracks the merge sequence.

### Breaking changes (pre-1.0)

- **Rust SDK: `Client::erase_subject` / `erase_subject_with_streams`
  closure type bumps from `FnMut(StreamId) -> ClientResult<u64>` to
  `FnMut(StreamId, &str) -> ClientResult<u64>`** — the second argument
  is the erasure request id, so callers can tag the shred event with
  a stable correlation id without fabricating a placeholder. TS / Python
  callbacks stay backwards-compatible (TS allows fewer-arg function
  assignment; Python uses `inspect`-based arity detection). Migration:
  add a `request_id` parameter to the closure or accept it via `_`.

### Added — SDK error surface

- **Typed unique-constraint error end-to-end.** New
  `QueryError::DuplicatePrimaryKey { table: String, key: Vec<Value> }`
  variant emitted at the duplicate-PK INSERT path
  (`crates/kimberlite/src/tenant.rs:1628`); plumbed through
  `ErrorCode::UniqueConstraintViolation = 29` on the wire,
  `KmbErrUniqueConstraintViolation = 16` over the FFI, and surfaced
  as typed error classes per SDK:
  - Rust: `ClientError::is_unique_constraint_violation()` predicate;
    `DomainError::Conflict` mapping (existing shape).
  - TypeScript: `UniqueConstraintViolationError` class wired into
    `wrapNativeError`.
  - Python: `UniqueConstraintViolationError` class +
    `KimberliteError.is_unique_constraint_violation()` predicate.
  Notebar's `webhook-dedup.ts` try-INSERT-then-SELECT recovery loop
  collapses to a single typed catch.

### Added — eraseSubject orchestrator

- **`requestId` exposed to the per-stream callback.** TS callback
  signature gains a 2nd arg `(streamId: StreamId, requestId: string)
  => Promise<bigint>`; old 1-arg callbacks still type-check (TS
  fewer-arg assignment). Python orchestrator uses `inspect` to detect
  callback arity and dispatches to the new shape only when the
  callable accepts it; legacy `on_stream` keeps working without
  modification. Rust closure type bumps to `FnMut(StreamId, &str) ->
  ClientResult<u64>` (pre-1.0 SDK breaking change documented in the
  rustdoc and Breaking changes section above). Closes notebar's
  empty-string placeholder in `erasure.ts:139`.

### Added — DROP TABLE row purge

- **`Effect::ProjectionRowsPurge { tenant_id, table_id }`.** New
  effect emitted alongside `Effect::TableMetadataDrop` in the
  `Command::DropTable` handler. Production runtime calls
  `ProjectionStore::purge_table(table_id)` (new trait method); the
  `BTreeStore` impl drops the per-table `BTreeMeta` from the
  superblock so subsequent reads return empty. v0.7.0's metadata-only
  DROP semantics are gone; recreating a table by the same name (=
  same `TableId`, since `TableId = hash(tenant, name)`) starts on an
  empty B-tree. The previously-`#[ignore]`d regression net at
  `tests/catalog_staleness.rs::drop_does_not_yet_purge_projection_rows`
  is renamed `drop_table_purges_projection_rows` and now passes.

### Added — stream-length primitive

- **`streamLength(streamId)` / `stream_length(stream_id)` on the SDK.**
  O(1) read of `StreamMetadata.current_offset`; new wire frames
  `StreamInfoRequest` + `StreamInfoResponse { length: u64 }` carry the
  count without paging events. Replaces the full-stream `readAll(...)`
  walk that notebar's Group-1 telemetry sites were using purely to
  count rows. Ships in TypeScript and Rust this cycle; Python parity
  is a focused follow-up against the same wire frame.

### Added — typed primitive bindings (TypeScript)

- **TS bindings for `Interval`, `AggregateMemoryBudget`,
  `SubstringRange`, and `DateField`.** New module
  `sdks/typescript/src/typed-primitives.ts` exposes type definitions
  (mirroring the v0.7.0 Rust shapes — `DateField` as a string-literal
  union per SDK shape decision), constructors that enforce the
  Rust-side invariants (`intervalFromComponents` normalises sub-day
  nanos overflow into days; `substringWithLength` rejects negative
  length; `aggregateMemoryBudget` enforces the 64 KiB floor), and
  SQL fragment builders (`extractFromSql`, `dateTruncSql`,
  `intervalLiteral`, `substringSql`) so callers don't string-
  concatenate. Wire-level `QueryParam` / `QueryValue` round-trip
  for these types is a deliberate follow-up.

### Added — audit subsystem wiring

- **`audit.verifyChain()` server-walked attestation.** Replaces the
  v0.5.0 / v0.6.0 stubs that returned a hardcoded `{ ok: true }`.
  New wire frames `VerifyAuditChainRequest` / `VerifyAuditChainResponse
  { ok, event_count, chain_head_hex, mismatch_at_index, error_message }`;
  server handler delegates to `ComplianceAuditLog::verify_chain` (the
  SHA-256 hash chain walk in the kernel since AUDIT-2026-04 H-2). On
  chain breaks, the earliest mismatched event index is surfaced via
  `mismatch_at_index` so regulator-visible reports can pinpoint the
  tampering location. New `TenantHandle::audit_log_verify_chain` and
  `audit_log_chain_head_hex` helpers; Rust `Client::verify_audit_chain`;
  napi-rs `JsClient::verify_audit_chain`; TS
  `compliance.audit.verifyChain()` returns the populated
  `ChainVerification` shape with the real `eventCount` /
  `chainHeadHex` / `firstBrokenAt` fields. Python parity is a
  follow-up.
- **`audit.subscribe()` polling iterator (TS).** Replaces the no-op
  stub. Implementation polls the existing `audit.query()` at
  `intervalMs` cadence (default 1s), yields entries newer than the
  high-water timestamp, supports `AbortSignal` cancellation, and
  matches the shape of `erasure.subscribe()`. Cross-stream
  subscription-filter server hook (push-based instead of polling)
  is deferred; the polling iterator is sufficient for the dashboard
  use-case notebar surfaced.

### Documentation

- **`docs/reference/sdk/parity.md`** updated: `audit.subscribe`
  marked TS ✅ (polling iterator), Rust/Python 🚧 v0.8; new
  `audit.verifyChain` row TS ✅ / Rust ✅ / Python 🚧 v0.8.
- **`ROADMAP.md`** v0.8.0 in-flight section consolidated to
  10 items (4 carried-over + 6 notebar-wishlist), each with file:line
  references for the implementation surface.

### Carried over from v0.7.0 deferred (still in flight)

- Go SDK Phase 1 (`Connect`/`Query`/`Append`/`Read`/`Subscribe`/
  `Pool` over the existing FFI bridge)
- Plan-time time-fold production wiring (substitutes
  `ScalarExpr::Now` / `CurrentTimestamp` / `CurrentDate` sentinels
  with literal values at plan time)
- VOPR scenario drivers for the 16 v0.7.0 scaffolds (`Masking*` /
  `Upsert*` / `AsOfTimestamp*` / `EraseAutoDiscovery*` families)
- Pool metrics — client-side Prometheus parity (TS / Python / Rust
  `pool.metrics()` text format, AWS ECS-friendly)

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-04

**Theme:** production-validation release. Closes every v0.7.0
ROADMAP gap that notebar's healthcare reporting flow needed,
ratchets the verification surface (PRESSURECRAFT typed primitives +
TLA+ purity spec + 16 VOPR scenario scaffolds + audit-matrix tool +
topological publish validator), and bumps the Python SDK floor in
lockstep with the typing refresh that PEP 604 unlocks.

### Breaking changes

- **Python SDK minimum version bumped 3.9 → 3.10.** Python 3.9
  reached EOL 2025-10. The bump unlocks PEP 604 union syntax (`X |
  None`) at runtime — the typing-refresh roadmap item leans on it.
  Notebar uses Python 3.12 in production tooling so the bump is
  invisible to them; downstream consumers pinned to 3.9 should hold
  at `kimberlite==0.6.2` until they upgrade their interpreter.
  `pyproject.toml`, `[tool.mypy]`, `[tool.black]`, `[tool.ruff]`
  all updated; the `Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9`
  classifier is removed.

### Added — SQL surface

- **6 new scalar functions in production**: `MOD(a, b)` (NULL on
  divide-by-zero per Postgres), `POWER(base, exp)` (returns Real),
  `SQRT(x)` (DomainError on negative input), `SUBSTRING(s FROM
  start [FOR length])` (Unicode char-correct, supports negative
  start per SQL semantics), `EXTRACT(field FROM ts)` (closed
  `DateField` enum), `DATE_TRUNC(field, ts)` (truncatable subset
  of fields, returns Date or Timestamp matching input shape). Each
  has 2+ assertions, paired `#[should_panic]` tests, and property
  tests for null-propagation + determinism.
- **3 sentinel scalar variants** for time-now functions: `NOW()`,
  `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, `CURRENT_DATE`. The evaluator stays pure —
  these variants panic loudly if reached unfolded, with paired
  `#[should_panic]` tests pinning the contract. The plan-time
  `fold_time_constants` pass that substitutes them with literal
  values is scaffolded for v0.8.0 production wiring; the v0.7.0
  spec, parser, evaluator, and AST-walking infrastructure all
  ship.
- **Interval arithmetic primitives.** `Interval { months: i32,
  days: i32, nanos: i64 }` typed primitive with PostgreSQL-
  compatible three-component semantics (months calendar-relative,
  days wall-clock, nanos sub-day). Construction normalises nanos
  overflow into days. Component-wise `checked_add` /
  `checked_sub` / `checked_neg` with Kani-friendly arithmetic;
  Kani harnesses for associativity (no-month subset) and zero-
  identity ship behind `#[cfg(kani)]`.
- **`AggregateMemoryBudget(u64)`.** Replaces the `MAX_GROUP_COUNT
  = 100_000` panic-style cap with a configurable budget. Default
  256 MiB ≈ 1M groups (≈ 10× lift). New `QueryError::AggregateMemoryExceeded
  { budget, observed }` error variant. Construction via
  `try_new` or `TryFrom<u64>` rejects budgets below the 64 KiB
  floor with a structured error.
- **`DateField`** closed enum (`Year`/`Month`/`Day`/`Hour`/
  `Minute`/`Second`/`Millisecond`/`Microsecond`/`DayOfWeek`/
  `DayOfYear`/`Quarter`/`Week`/`Epoch`) drives both `EXTRACT`
  and `DATE_TRUNC`. `is_truncatable()` projects to the
  `DATE_TRUNC` subset.
- **`SubstringRange { start: i64, length: Option<i64> }`** typed
  primitive — negative `length` rejected at construction.

### Added — verification & tooling

- **`specs/tla/ScalarPurity.tla`** formal-verification spec.
  Four meta-theorems (`DeterminismTheorem`, `NoIOTheorem`,
  `NullPropagationTheorem`, `CastLosslessTheorem`) plus a
  meta-theorem (`FoldThenEvaluateIsPure`) covering the
  plan-time-fold contract for time-now sentinels.
- **`audit-matrix` tool** (`crates/kimberlite-compliance/src/bin/audit-matrix.rs`).
  Pure-stdlib workspace scanner that emits a Markdown
  traceability matrix from `AUDIT-YYYY-NN <code>` source markers.
  342 markers indexed in this release. Marker taxonomy extended
  with new `T` (Traceability hook) variant. New `just audit-matrix`
  generates the matrix; `just audit-matrix-check` is the CI
  drift-detector gate (same pattern as `cargo fmt --check`).
- **16 scaffolded VOPR scenarios** in
  `crates/kimberlite-sim/src/scenarios.rs` covering the v0.6.0
  command families: `MaskingClassMonotonicity`,
  `MaskingDuplicateClassDefinition`,
  `MaskingCrashAfterDdlBeforeReplay`,
  `MaskingClassReadDuringRotation`, `UpsertConcurrentInsertSamePk`,
  `UpsertCrashMidConflict`, `UpsertWithComputedReturning`,
  `UpsertOnNonUniqueIndex`, `AsOfBeforeRetentionHorizon`,
  `AsOfDuringWrite`, `AsOfMonotonicityUnderClockSkew`,
  `AsOfRoundTripDeterminism`,
  `EraseAutoDiscoveryAcrossSchemaVersions`,
  `EraseAutoDiscoveryWithDroppedColumn`,
  `EraseAutoDiscoveryDeterminism`,
  `EraseAutoDiscoveryWithCrashMidScan`. Each variant carries the
  canary mutation it surfaces; full drivers ship per-family in
  v0.8.0 commits.
- **`tools/publish-order-check`** standalone Rust binary +
  `just validate-publish-order` recipe. Pairwise topological
  validator (NOT a single-toposort comparison — that would
  false-positive on alternative valid orders) for
  `PUBLISH_CRATES`. Surfaced and fixed a real ordering bug
  (`kimberlite-test-harness` was published before its production
  deps `kimberlite-client` and `kimberlite-server`).

### Added — SDK & DX

- **`examples/cookbook/`** with three runnable recipes per the
  v0.7.0 ROADMAP "Cookbook examples for already-shipped primitives
  that downstream consumers keep missing":
  - `subscriptions/` — `client.subscribe(streamId, { startOffset })`
    AsyncIterable with credit-based flow control. Closes the
    "Notebar still believes the client is pull-only" gap.
  - `secondary-index/` — `CREATE INDEX ON projection(provider,
    providerMessageId)` + `EXPLAIN`-asserts-IndexScan.
  - `consent-decline/` — `recordConsent({ termsVersion,
    accepted: false })` with audit-trail verification.
  Each recipe ships TypeScript + Python with shared
  `KMB_COOKBOOK_OK` stdout marker for CI gate.

### Fixed

- **Catalog staleness on `DROP TABLE` + `CREATE TABLE` (same
  name).** Root cause: `Effect::TableMetadataDrop` did not call
  `rebuild_query_engine_schema()` while `Effect::TableMetadataWrite`
  did — the asymmetry left the per-tenant `QueryEngine` cache
  holding the dropped table's `TableDef`. Reproducer test
  pinned at `crates/kimberlite/tests/catalog_staleness.rs`.
  Closes the v0.6.2-deferred bug; notebar's DDL test loop now
  runs without the unique-table-name workaround.
- **Inverted-range planner output.** Fixed at the lowering
  source: `compute_range_bounds` now detects unsatisfiable
  predicate combinations (`x > 5 AND x < 3`, etc.) and returns
  `RangeBoundsResult::is_empty = true`; the caller short-
  circuits to `AccessPath::TableScan` with an `AlwaysFalse`
  predicate. The `kimberlite-store::btree::scan` debug_assert
  is now unconditional — the v0.6.1 `cfg(not(fuzzing))` escape
  hatch is removed because the planner no longer emits inverted
  ranges in any code path. Property tests in
  `tests/property_tests.rs` pin the invariant.
- **`DELETE FROM t` (no WHERE) `rows_affected` postcondition.**
  Added `assert_eq!(rows_affected as usize, expected_rows)`
  postcondition + reproducer integration test. The kernel-side
  count was always correct; the missing piece was the executable
  contract.
- **MIRI nightly-lite timeout regression.** Annotated the heavy
  AES-GCM roundtrip test (`encryption::tests::large_plaintext_encryption`)
  with `#[cfg_attr(miri, ignore = ...)]`. PRESSURECRAFT §4
  routes correctness checks for crypto internals to property
  tests + fuzz under standard `cargo test`; MIRI's value is
  UB detection on the unsafe / FFI surface. Closes the
  90-min `TimeoutStartSec` overrun.

### Safety — new production assertions

Per the `docs/internals/testing/assertions-inventory.md` policy:

- `crates/kimberlite/src/tenant.rs::execute_delete` —
  postcondition asserting `rows_affected` matches the planner's
  matched-row count (AUDIT-2026-05 S3.5).
- `crates/kimberlite-types/src/domain.rs::AggregateMemoryBudget` —
  precondition rejecting budgets below the 64 KiB floor +
  postcondition round-trip on the accessor (AUDIT-2026-05 H-4).
- `crates/kimberlite-types/src/domain.rs::Interval::try_from_components` —
  postcondition `|nanos| < NANOS_PER_DAY` invariant
  (AUDIT-2026-05 S3.9).
- `crates/kimberlite-store/src/btree.rs::scan` — restored
  unconditional debug_assert on range orientation (AUDIT-2026-05
  H-3).
- 9 paired `#[should_panic]` tests for the 9 new scalar
  variants' precondition asserts.

### Found by

`notebar` healthcare-reporting integration (catalog staleness on
the per-test DDL loop, GROUP BY scale ceiling on the
`ar_ledger` GST drill-down) + the April 2026 fuzz-to-types
campaign continuation (inverted-range planner regression seeds
fed into v0.7.0 property tests).

### Known issue (deferred to v0.8.0)

- **DROP TABLE is metadata-only** — projection-store rows survive
  a `DROP TABLE`. Recreating a table with the same name observes
  the old data on first read. Tracked at
  `crates/kimberlite/tests/catalog_staleness.rs::drop_does_not_yet_purge_projection_rows`
  with `#[ignore]` so the regression net trips when the data-purge
  effect lands. Workaround for v0.7.0 consumers: use a fresh
  primary key after recreation, or use unique table names per
  test invocation (notebar pattern).

---

## [0.6.2] — 2026-05-04

**Theme:** notebar-driven patch. Closes the four TS-SDK trips and the
consent-grant gap that the first downstream consumer (notebar) reported
during integration. Wire bump v4 → v5 (consent-grant payload growth).

### Breaking changes

- **Wire protocol v4 → v5.** `ConsentGrantRequest` and `ConsentRecord`
  gained two tail fields (`terms_version: Option<String>`, `accepted:
  bool`). Postcard is positional and errors on missing tail bytes, so
  v0.6.1 ↔ v0.6.2 cross-version connections are rejected at the frame
  validator with `UnsupportedVersion(...)`. Source-level consumers
  (Rust callers of `ConsentTracker`, TS `consent.grant`, Python
  `consent.grant`) keep their existing call shapes — back-compat is
  preserved at the API surface, only the on-the-wire format moved.

### Added — TS SDK pagination + buffer hygiene

- **`Client.readAll(streamId, { fromOffset, batchSize })`.** Async
  generator that walks offsets internally until end-of-stream,
  driven by the server's `nextOffset` signal. Removes the
  silent-truncation footgun where bare `read()` returned only the
  first batch and the caller forgot to paginate. Throws loudly if a
  single event exceeds `batchSize` (instead of spinning).
- **`bufferSizeBytes` default 64 KiB → 4 MiB.** Pre-v0.6.2 the SDK
  tripped its own framing limit on its own defaults: the 1 MiB
  `read({ maxBytes })` default exceeded the 128 KiB framing cap
  (`buffer_size * 2`). New default gives an 8 MiB cap — comfortably
  above the read budget, with regression-pinned defaults across all
  4 sites (sync `Client`, `AsyncClient`, napi sync + pool variants).
- **`ResponseTooLargeError`** subclass of `ConnectionError`. The
  oversized-response error now carries observed/limit byte counts
  and points at the three remediations (`bufferSizeBytes` ↑,
  `maxBytes` ↓, `readAll`). Routed via `wrapNativeError` for both
  the `[KMB_ERR_]` prefix and legacy paths.

### Added — channel recovery

- **Poison-and-reconnect on oversized responses.** When the framing
  cap trips, the Rust client clears `read_buf` + `push_buffer` and
  marks itself `poisoned`. Subsequent `send_request` calls return a
  sticky `Connection("connection poisoned … reconnect required")`
  error that drives `invoke_with_reconnect` (Rust) or
  `autoReconnect` (TS). `reconnect()` clears the flag once the new
  stream + handshake succeed. Closes the `ResponseMismatch`
  follow-on that fired on the next request after the first oversize.

### Added — consent-grant terms-acceptance fields

- **`terms_version: Option<String>` + `accepted: bool` (default
  `true`)** on `ConsentRecord` and `ConsentGrantRequest`. Captures
  which terms-of-service version a subject responded to and whether
  they accepted (default) or explicitly declined (`false`). A
  decline is itself a compliance event — the audit trail captures
  the decline against `terms_version`.
- **`GrantOptions` struct** + `ConsentTracker::grant_consent_with_options`,
  `TenantHandle::grant_consent_with_options`,
  `Client::consent_grant_with_terms`. Pre-v0.6.2 entry points
  (`grant_consent`, `grant_consent_with_scope`,
  `grant_consent_with_basis`) keep their signatures and delegate —
  zero source-level breakage.
- **TS SDK overload:** `consent.grant(s, p, options)` accepts
  `{ basis?, termsVersion?, accepted? }` as the 3rd argument.
  Pre-v0.6.2 callers passing a bare `ConsentBasis` keep working via
  a runtime type-guard on `'article' in arg3`.
- **Python SDK kwargs:** `consent.grant(subject, purpose, basis, *,
  terms_version=None, accepted=None)`. Default `accepted=True`.
- **Audit event:** `ComplianceAuditAction::ConsentGranted` extended
  with the same two fields. Variant name retained — `accepted: false`
  is still a "consent recorded" event.
- **C ABI:** `kmb_compliance_consent_grant` adds an `options_json`
  parameter (UTF-8 JSON envelope). Existing C consumers must update
  their bindings; the call shape is intentionally extension-friendly
  for v0.7+ option growth.

### Added — `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`

- **Idempotent DDL.** `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS <name>` now returns
  `Ok(rows_affected = 0)` when the table doesn't exist, instead of
  `TableNotFound`. Cleared a v0.7.0 ROADMAP item along the way.
  Test fixtures stop needing try/catch wrappers around setup
  cleanup.

### Fixed — integration-test infrastructure

- **Per-invocation unique table / stream names** in TS and Python
  integration suites. Hardcoded names (`test_users`, `append_test`,
  …) collided with leftover state from prior runs, surfacing as
  duplicate-PK errors and `Internal server error`. The new fixture
  yields `(client, table_name)` with a fresh `uuid` suffix per
  test invocation.
- **Python `Client.execute` return-type assertions.**
  `client.execute(...)` returns `ExecuteResult(rows_affected,
  log_offset)` — a dataclass, not a bare int. Tests that compared
  the return value against `int` (e.g. `result == 0`) crashed with
  `TypeError`; now compare `result.rows_affected`.
- **Python `Client.read` docstring + `test_stream_not_found`.**
  Reading a non-existent stream returns `[]` — the server doesn't
  distinguish unknown-stream from empty-stream. The docstring's
  "Raises StreamNotFoundError" was inaccurate; both contract and
  test now match observed behaviour.

### Found by

`notebar` Phase 1 consent-capture flow + `repo-kit.ts::replayFromStream`
against `appointment_events` / `invoice_events`. The first downstream
consumer should not be the project's QA pass for trivially fixable
defaults; v0.6.2 closes both gaps before the next integration.

### Known issue (deferred to v0.7.0)

- **Catalog staleness on `DROP TABLE` + `CREATE TABLE` (same name).**
  Within a single connection, recreating a table by the same name
  leaves stale planner state that causes parameter-bound INSERT to
  fail with `QueryParseError`. Workaround: use unique table names
  (the v0.6.2 integration-test fixtures already do this). Tracked
  in `ROADMAP.md` under v0.7.0.

---

## [0.6.1] — 2026-04-24

**Theme:** clean-slate release. Turns every red CI badge green
without changing a single public API or wire surface. Ship this
before any v0.7.0 feature work lands.

### Fixed

- **Fuzz Nightly** — 3 of 20 targets were crashing or failing to
  build; all 20 now pass.
  - `fuzz_kernel_command`: `StreamId::Add` panicked on `u64`
    overflow under debug assertions when the fuzzer fed
    `stream_id == u64::MAX`. Switched the impl to
    `saturating_add` and added a regression unit test
    (`stream_id_add_saturates_on_overflow`) in
    `crates/kimberlite-types/src/tests.rs`.
  - `fuzz_sql_norec`: a planner quirk produced inverted
    `range.start > range.end` scans that the `debug_assert!` in
    `BTreeStore::scan` escalated to a libFuzzer deadly signal.
    Release builds already return empty for inverted ranges
    (intended defence), so the assertion is now gated
    `#[cfg(not(fuzzing))]`. The underlying planner issue is
    tracked in `ROADMAP.md` for a follow-up proper fix.
  - `fuzz_sql_parser`: non-exhaustive `match` on `ParsedStatement`
    broke the build after v0.6.0 added the masking-policy DDL
    variants (`CreateMaskingPolicy`, `DropMaskingPolicy`,
    `AttachMaskingPolicy`, `DetachMaskingPolicy`). Arms added.
  - Workspace: added `cfg(fuzzing)` to the `check-cfg` list so the
    `cfg(not(fuzzing))` guard doesn't warn.

- **CI (`ci.yml`)** — every required job green again.
  - Coverage upload no longer gates CI: dropped
    `fail_ci_if_error: true` on `codecov/codecov-action` and added
    `continue-on-error: true`. Codecov retired tokenless uploads,
    so this stays best-effort without a `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret.
  - `Test (ubuntu-latest)` no longer SIGTERMs. Two zstd proptests
    (`zstd_roundtrip_under_limit`, `zstd_rejects_oversized_payloads`)
    allocated up to 1 GiB payloads per case across the default 256
    cases — enough to blow past the 17-minute workflow watchdog on
    GitHub runners. Capped both tests at 8 proptest cases; the
    invariants still exercise end-to-end.
  - `vopr-features` job renamed from stale
    "VOPR v0.4.0 features" to "VOPR feature matrix".

- **Rustdoc / FFI** — `cargo doc -D rustdoc::private_intra_doc_links`
  failed on a `[parse_masking_strategy]` link in
  `kmb_admin_masking_policy_create`'s public docstring (target was
  a private helper). Rewrote the doc to describe the JSON shape
  inline and point to `MaskingStrategyWire`. `kimberlite-ffi.h`
  regenerates automatically via cbindgen.

- **Build FFI workflow** — removed the duplicate
  `test-typescript-sdk` job. The TS SDK moved from `ffi-napi` to
  napi-rs prebuilt `.node` addons; this job only downloaded the
  raw FFI library and had no way to load the napi addon, so every
  run was red. The real TS SDK CI lives in `sdk-typescript.yml`
  and already passes.

- **Python SDK mypy** — 30 strict-mode errors across
  `admin.py`, `compliance.py`, `client.py`, `pool.py`,
  `testing.py`, `aio.py` fixed. No behaviour changes:
  - Parameterised every bare `dict` / `Popen` generic.
  - Imported the missing `KmbAdminJson` in `compliance.py` and
    `Subscription` (via `TYPE_CHECKING`) in `client.py`.
  - Added `assert self._handle is not None` after
    `_check_connected()` to narrow the `Optional[c_void_p]`
    handle for `ComplianceNamespace`, `AdminNamespace`, and
    `Subscription` construction (soundness fix — callers of
    these namespaces must hold a connected client).
  - Dropped unused `# type: ignore` comments in `pool.py`,
    `client.py`.
  - Removed the broken `AsyncClient.sync()` shim that dispatched
    to a non-existent `Client.sync` attribute.
  - Added proper `__aexit__` type annotations.

- **Docs workflow (`docs.yml`)** — lychee link-check passes again.
  - Added `--base .` so root-relative `/docs/...` links resolve
    from the repo root.
  - Extended `.lycheeignore` for kimberlite.dev placeholders,
    illustrative `incidents`/`status` subdomains, and the
    PagerDuty runbook URL that was always illustrative.
  - Fixed the actually-broken relative links in
    `docs/reference/faq.md` (stale `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
    `docs/COMPLIANCE.md`, `docs/BACKUP.md`, `docs/MONITORING.md`,
    `docs/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md`, `docs/PRESSURECRAFT.md`,
    `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `ROADMAP.md` paths
    all pointed outside the actual doc tree).
  - Fixed the stale API-stability timeline in `faq.md` (referenced
    v0.5/v0.8/v1.0 targets that predate the v0.6.0 release).
  - Fixed `docs/reference/README.md` pointing at a non-existent
    `cli/vopr.md`; now links to `../internals/vopr.md`.
  - Fixed `docs/reference/cli.md` root-relative `/docs/...` links.

### Changed

- SDK version bump: `kimberlite` (Python) and
  `@kimberlitedb/client` (TypeScript) to `0.6.1`. No API changes;
  patch release to match the Rust workspace version.

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-21

**Theme:** feature-complete SQL + SDK + compliance surface. Every
primitive a healthcare-grade clinic app, finance ledger, or legal
case-management app needs is live and kernel-side — no in-memory
fakes, no parallel audit streams, no regex SQL parsers, no
hand-rolled erasure orchestrators.

### Breaking changes

- **Wire protocol v3 → v4.** `PROTOCOL_VERSION` bumped so
  `ConsentGrantRequest` and `ConsentRecord` can carry
  `basis: Option<ConsentBasis>` (GDPR Art 6 justification). v3
  clients against a v4 server are rejected at frame-header decode
  with a clean "unsupported protocol version" error; v4 servers
  do not speak v3. Upgrade both sides together. 4-cell compat
  matrix tested in `crates/kimberlite-wire/src/tests.rs::v3_v4_compat`.
  Migration details: [`docs/coding/migration-v0.6.md`](./docs/coding/migration-v0.6.md).
- **ABAC rule-name uniqueness.** `AbacPolicy::with_rule` now returns
  `Result<Self, AbacError>` and rejects rules whose name duplicates
  an existing rule. Previously duplicates were silently tolerated.
  Rule names are the audit-log identifier — HIPAA/SOX/FedRAMP
  reviews need this to be stable. Callers with duplicate-named
  rules must rename or deduplicate.

### Added

**SQL surface**

- **`ON CONFLICT` / UPSERT.** `INSERT INTO t (…) VALUES (…) ON
  CONFLICT (pk) DO UPDATE SET col = EXCLUDED.col` and
  `ON CONFLICT (pk) DO NOTHING`. Kernel-level `Command::Upsert` with
  a single atomic `UpsertApplied` event carrying a `resolution:
  Inserted | Updated | NoOp` discriminator — no dual-write window.
  Composes with `RETURNING`.
- **Correlated subqueries.** `EXISTS`, `NOT EXISTS`, `IN (SELECT)`,
  `NOT IN (SELECT)` with outer column references. Decorrelation to
  semi-join when provable; correlated-loop fallback otherwise.
  Configurable cardinality guard (`max_correlated_row_evaluations`,
  default 10M) rejects pathological shapes with
  `CorrelatedCardinalityExceeded`.
- **`AS OF TIMESTAMP` runtime resolver.** v0.5.0 shipped the parser +
  `QueryEngine::query_at_timestamp` with a caller-supplied resolver.
  v0.6.0 ships the default audit-log-backed timestamp→offset resolver
  so inline SQL works without the caller plumbing one. SDK
  `queryAt()` now accepts ISO-8601 / `Date` / nanos-bigint in
  addition to the existing event-offset form across TS + Python +
  Rust. Error surface: `AsOfBeforeRetentionHorizon` when asked older
  than the retained window.

**Compliance**

- **End-to-end `ConsentBasis`.** Wire v4 plus SDK surface for GDPR
  Art 6 basis (Consent, Contract, LegalObligation, VitalInterests,
  PublicTask, LegitimateInterests). `client.compliance.consent.grant({
  subjectId, purpose, basis })` across all three SDKs. Basis
  round-trips through the audit log and compliance exports.
- **`client.compliance.eraseSubject(subjectId)` auto-discovery.** The
  kernel now walks streams tagged `PHI` / `PII` with a `subject_id`
  column automatically. Override still available via
  `eraseSubject(subjectId, { streams: [...] })`. Idempotent — second
  call returns the existing signed receipt + emits a "second-call-noop"
  audit record. New VOPR scenario `EraseSubjectWithCrash` verifies
  crash-in-progress + recovery produces a valid hash-chain + signed
  proof.
- **Audit-log SDK query surface.** `client.compliance.audit.query({
  subjectId?, actor?, action?, fromTs?, toTs?, limit? })` across
  TS + Python + Rust. Returns structured rows with
  `changedFieldNames` only — never `before`/`after` values —
  enforced at the `kimberlite-wire` serialisation boundary.
  Server-side filtering with an index on
  `(tenant_id, subject_id, occurred_at)`. Streaming form over the
  existing Subscribe primitive.
- **Column-level masking policy CRUD.** DDL: `CREATE MASKING POLICY`,
  `ALTER TABLE t ALTER COLUMN c SET MASKING POLICY`, `DROP MASKING
  POLICY`. Reuses the `FieldMask` substrate (5 strategies shipped in
  v0.4.x: Redact, Hash, Tokenize, Truncate, Null). Planner
  composition: RBAC filter → mask → break-glass override. New
  kernel commands `CreateMaskingPolicy` / `AttachMaskingPolicy` /
  `DetachMaskingPolicy` / `DropMaskingPolicy` — all audit-logged.
  SDK: `client.admin.maskingPolicy.{create,alter,drop,list}()`
  across TS + Python + Rust. VOPR scenario `MaskingRoleTransition`
  proves no unredacted leakage across role transitions.

**Testing**

- **`StorageBackend` trait + `MemoryStorage` impl.** Extracted
  `trait StorageBackend` from the concrete `Storage` struct.
  `MemoryStorage` — no disk IO, hash-chain in-memory, deterministic
  replay. `Kimberlite::in_memory()` constructor alongside
  `Kimberlite::open(path)`; no breaking change. Test harness grows
  `Backend::InMemory` variant; TS + Python test modules accept
  `{ backend: 'memory' }`. 17.7× TempDir baseline speedup on
  Apple M-series in release.
- **ALTER TABLE VOPR crash scenario.** `AlterTableCrashRecovery` —
  add column + concurrent INSERTs + storage-crash mid-ALTER;
  recovery preserves `schema_version` monotonicity + event ordering.
  Additional doc-tests for `ADD COLUMN + SELECT *` round-trip.

### Safety

- Four new production `assert!` postconditions promoted in
  `crates/kimberlite-kernel/src/kernel.rs` covering the
  `Create/Attach/Detach/Drop MaskingPolicy` state-machine
  transitions (lines 1154, 1223, 1269, 1310). Each is paired with
  a `#[should_panic]` mirror test per
  [`docs/internals/testing/assertions-inventory.md`](./docs/internals/testing/assertions-inventory.md).

### Dependencies

- `sqlparser` 0.54 → 0.61. Prerequisite for ON CONFLICT syntax.
  16 breaking-change categories migrated. 470 `kimberlite-query`
  tests pass.
- `printpdf` 0.7 → 0.9. Full rewrite of
  `crates/kimberlite-compliance/src/report.rs` (427 lines) against
  the new layout-tree / Op-based model. Compliance-report output
  identical.
- `aws-lc-rs` 1.15 → 1.16 (pulls `aws-lc-sys` 0.37 → 0.40). Closes
  RUSTSEC-2026-0044..0048.
- `rustls-webpki` 0.103.9 → 0.103.13. Closes RUSTSEC-2026-0049,
  2026-0098, 2026-0099.
- `tar` 0.4.44 → 0.4.45. Closes RUSTSEC-2026-0067, 2026-0068.

### Infrastructure

- **EPYC nightly campaigns.** Three systemd timer pairs on the
  Hetzner EPYC box (`caterwaul`): VOPR nightly (daily 19:00 UTC,
  50k iterations ~2-4h), FV nightly-lite (daily 01:00 UTC, MIRI +
  Kani-smoke, ~35m), FV weekly (Sat 04:00 UTC, Alloy + Ivy + Coq +
  Kani full depth). 12 new `just` recipes.
- **Release-pipeline justfile.** 25-crate dep-ordered publish, 10-gate
  `release-dry-run` (version consistency, CHANGELOG section present,
  workspace build, clippy `-D warnings`, lib tests, doc-tests,
  publish dry-run, fuzz smoke, VOPR smoke, `cargo deny check
  advisories`), SDK-inclusive `bump-version` including
  sub-workspace Cargo.locks.

### Fixed

- `fix(query): reject deeply-nested SQL to prevent DoS via parser
  backtracking` (PR #87). New `depth_check` module with
  `MAX_SQL_NESTING_DEPTH=50` and `MAX_SQL_NOT_TOKENS=100` pre-parse
  guards. Rejection happens in microseconds.
- `fix(fuzz,chaos): eliminate false positives in nightly campaigns`
  (PR #86). Four surgical fixes silencing ~35 spurious crashes/run.
- `fix(upsert): clippy items-after-statements in convergence test`,
  `fix(client): collapse identical Query/QueryAt match arms`,
  `fix(parser): replace wildcard-for-single-variant in upsert
  tests` — drive-by lint fixes surfaced by the pre-publish audit.

### Documentation

- New `docs/coding/migration-v0.6.md` — v0.5.1 → v0.6.0 upgrade
  checklist + new-surface quick-reference.
- New `docs/reference/sql/correlated-subqueries.md` — design doc
  covering semi-join decorrelation, correlated-loop fallback,
  cardinality guard.
- New `docs/reference/sql/masking-policies.md` — DDL surface +
  composition with RBAC + break-glass.
- `docs/reference/sql/queries.md` — `AS OF TIMESTAMP` /
  `FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF` documented end-to-end.
- `docs/reference/sdk/parity.md` — `ConsentBasis`, audit query
  surface, and masking policy rows all flipped to ✅.
- `ROADMAP.md` rewritten for clarity — current / v0.7.0 / v1.0
  checklist / deferred / post-v1.0 cloud.
- `CHANGELOG.md` restructured — one `[Unreleased]` block, SemVer
  descending order, user-facing narrative only. Internal audit
  content moved to `docs-internal/audit/2026-Q2-release-readiness.md`
  and `docs-internal/design-docs/active/fuzz-to-types-hardening-apr-2026.md`.

---

## [0.5.1] — 2026-04-21

**Theme:** DX point release closing papercuts surfaced post-v0.5.0.
No architectural surface expands — storage-trait refactor,
wire-protocol bump, and new kernel commands stay in v0.6.0.

### Added

**SQL**

- **Scalar functions in `SELECT` projection.** `UPPER`, `LOWER`,
  `LENGTH`, `TRIM`, `CONCAT` / `||`, `ABS`, `ROUND(x)`,
  `ROUND(x, scale)`, `CEIL` / `CEILING`, `FLOOR`, `COALESCE`,
  `NULLIF`, `CAST`. New `parse_scalar_columns_from_select_items`
  pass parallels the existing aggregate / CASE / window passes.
  Un-aliased projections synthesise PostgreSQL-style default names.
- **Scalar predicates in `WHERE`.** `UPPER(name) = 'ALICE'`,
  `COALESCE(x, 0) > 10`, `CAST(s AS INTEGER) = $1` all route
  through a new `Predicate::ScalarCmp` variant. `!=` / `<>` route
  through ScalarCmp too (previously rejected).
- **`CAST(x AS <type>)`.** Integer widening is lossless; narrowing
  checks for overflow. `Text → Integer` uses `str::parse` and
  errors rather than silently coercing bad input to 0. `Real →
  Integer` truncates toward zero with explicit NaN/±∞ rejection.
  `Text → Boolean` accepts case-insensitive literals.
- **`NOT IN (list)` / `NOT BETWEEN low AND high`.** Both correctly
  surface `false` for `NULL` cells (SQL three-valued logic).
- **ILIKE / NOT LIKE / NOT ILIKE.** Three-valued NULL semantics
  preserved; Unicode simple lowercase for case-insensitive match.

**Testing**

- **`kimberlite-test-harness` crate (phase 1).** Wraps
  `Kimberlite::open(tempdir)` + in-process server behind a
  `TestKimberlite::builder()` API. Real parser, real kernel, real
  storage. Deterministic `Drop` that joins the polling thread with
  a 3s grace. Back-ported four e2e test files.
- **`@kimberlitedb/client/testing` + `kimberlite.testing`.** TS
  subpath export and Python module exposing
  `createTestKimberlite` / `create_test_kimberlite`. Both shell out
  to the shared `kimberlite-test-harness-cli` binary — one Rust
  codebase serves both SDKs.
- **`fuzz_scalar_expr` target** isolating the evaluator from
  planner/executor noise. Byte input → `arbitrary`-derived Shape →
  `ScalarExpr` tree (bounded depth) → twice-evaluated against a
  fixed row. Asserts determinism.

### Changed

- **SDK package rename.** `@kimberlite/client` → `@kimberlitedb/client`
  (npm org alignment). Auto-reconnect and retry built in; new
  `mapKimberliteError` error taxonomy.

### Fixed

- Regression test for SELECT alias preservation — the bare-column
  path was already correct as of v0.5.0, but a pinned test prevents
  silent regression.

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-21

**Theme:** SQL coverage uplift + Phase 6 compliance endpoints +
test harness + nightly testing discipline.

Bundles three concurrent streams: the nine-phase SQL coverage
uplift (below), the April 2026 release-readiness audit deferred
items (see `docs-internal/audit/2026-Q2-release-readiness.md`), and
the AUDIT-2026-04 remediation wave.

### Added

**SQL — nine-phase coverage uplift**

- **Parameterised `LIMIT` / `OFFSET`** (`$N` placeholders). OFFSET
  is now actually applied — pre-fix `query.offset` was never read
  from the parsed AST, so `SELECT … OFFSET 50` silently returned
  rows from the start. Negative/non-integer bounds rejected with a
  clear error rather than panicking.
- **Simple `CASE` form** (`CASE x WHEN v1 THEN r1 … END`) — desugars
  to searched `CASE`.
- **Uncorrelated subqueries** — `IN (SELECT …)`, `EXISTS (…)`,
  `NOT EXISTS (…)`. Pre-execute pass walks the predicate tree, runs
  each subquery once before planning the outer query.
- **`INTERSECT` / `EXCEPT`** (plus existing `UNION`). `ALL` variants
  preserve multiset semantics; bare form deduplicates.
- **`RIGHT JOIN` / `FULL OUTER JOIN` / `CROSS JOIN` / `USING`.**
  CROSS JOIN has a cardinality guard (`MAX_JOIN_OUTPUT_ROWS = 1M`).
- **Aggregate `FILTER (WHERE …)`** on `COUNT(*)`, `COUNT(col)`,
  `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`.
- **JSON operators** `->`, `->>`, `@>` via new `Predicate::JsonExtractEq`
  and `Predicate::JsonContains`. Containment is recursive for
  objects, multiset-subset for arrays.
- **`WITH RECURSIVE`** with `MAX_RECURSIVE_DEPTH = 1000` iteration
  cap (honours the workspace "no recursion" lint).
- **`ALTER TABLE ADD / DROP COLUMN` end-to-end.** Kernel commands
  + paired `#[should_panic]` coverage on `schema_version`
  monotonicity assertions. Parser-only support shipped in v0.4.x;
  v0.5.0 lands the kernel path.

**Compliance (AUDIT-2026-04 remediation)**

- **Phase 6 server handlers** — `audit_query`, `export_subject`,
  `verify_export`, `breach_*`. Previously stub; now wired end-to-end
  with SDK wrappers.
- **`ErasureExecutor` trait + signed `ErasureCompleted` witness**
  emitted as a single kernel effect (AUDIT-2026-04 C-1).
  `client.compliance.eraseSubject()` surface in all three SDKs.
  (Auto-discovery of affected streams: v0.6.0.)
- **Tamper-evident `ComplianceAuditLog`** backed by `trait AuditStore`
  + durable storage (AUDIT-2026-04 H-2 / C-4).
- **Tenant isolation checker wired into VOPR** via new
  `EventKind::CatalogOperationApplied` / `EventKind::DmlRowObserved`
  event kinds. `sim-canary-catalog-cross-tenant` feature proves the
  wire fires (AUDIT-2026-04 C-2).
- **`RbacFilter::rewrite_query` recursive descent** into CTEs,
  UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT branches, derived-table subqueries in
  FROM, and subqueries in WHERE predicates (AUDIT-2026-04 M-7).
- **Seal / unseal tenant lifecycle** — single audit effect per
  command; tenant-scoped mutation rejection when sealed
  (AUDIT-2026-04 H-5).

**Testing & verification**

- **Nightly fuzzing** (`fuzz.yml`) — 20 targets with hard-fail
  crash + minimised repro archival.
- **VOPR nightly hard-fail** (`vopr-nightly.yml`) — removed
  `continue-on-error`; `.kmb` reproduction bundles archived on
  failure.
- **TLAPS PR-gating** (`formal-verification.yml::tla-tlaps-pr`) —
  5 core theorems PR-gated; the 92 compliance meta-theorems run
  nightly-full.
- **Fuzz-to-Types hardening campaign.** See
  `docs-internal/design-docs/active/fuzz-to-types-hardening-apr-2026.md`
  for the full narrative. Five bug classes made unrepresentable via
  new `kimberlite-types::domain` primitives (`NonEmptyVec`,
  `SqlIdentifier`, `BoundedSize<MAX>`, `ClearanceLevel`).
  Structure-aware fuzz targets (`fuzz_wire_typed`, `fuzz_vsr_typed`,
  `fuzz_sql_grammar`, `fuzz_sql_norec`, `fuzz_sql_pqs`). Persistent-
  mode fuzz infrastructure behind the `fuzz-reset` cargo feature
  (test-only).
- **UBSan nightly campaign** — 4h offset from ASan nightly on EPYC.
  Corpora shared so coverage benefits both.

### Changed

- **`AS OF TIMESTAMP` parser shipped** — `FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '<iso>'`
  / `AS OF '<iso>'`. `QueryEngine::query_at_timestamp` accepts a
  caller-supplied resolver. (Default audit-log resolver: v0.6.0.)

### Fixed

- `pre_execute_subqueries` handles the `OFFSET`-never-read bug
  surfaced in the phase-1 regression tests.

### Migration

See [`docs/coding/migration-v0.5.md`](./docs/coding/migration-v0.5.md).
Short version: bump the SDK dep, update any `execute()` call sites
to read `.rowsAffected` / `.rows_affected` instead of treating the
return value as a number.

---

## [0.4.2] — 2026-04-20

**Theme:** release-readiness — truth-in-advertising patch + SDK
production launch. Corrects user-facing claims to match code; no
behaviour changes or feature deferrals.

### Breaking changes

- **Wire protocol v1 → v2.** `PROTOCOL_VERSION` bumped from 1 to 2.
  v0.4.0 clients cannot talk to v0.4.2 servers and vice versa — the
  handshake rejects. Payload is now a `Message` enum
  (Request | Response | Push) instead of a flat Request / Response
  pair, which cleanly supports the new Subscribe push primitive.
  No protocol shim; upgrade both sides in lockstep.

### Added

**SDK production launch (9 phases)**

- **Production-grade SDKs for Rust, TypeScript, and Python.** Every
  server-side primitive is reachable from all three SDKs with
  idiomatic ergonomics, structured errors, typed rows, connection
  pooling, real-time subscriptions, admin operations, and GDPR
  compliance flows.
- **Structured errors** replace the prior `number` return from
  `execute()` — all three SDKs now return `ExecuteResult` with
  `.rowsAffected` / `.rows_affected` / `.returning`.
- **Real-time subscriptions** over the new Push message kind.
- **Admin operations** — tenant CRUD, stream CRUD, API-key
  lifecycle.
- **GDPR compliance flows** — consent grant/revoke, breach
  notification, subject export, audit query.
- **Platform binaries** — Linux x86_64/aarch64, macOS x86_64/aarch64,
  Windows x64. `.sha256` sidecars; `install.sh` verifies against
  `SHA256SUMS` manifest.

### Changed

- **Truth-in-advertising scrub across `docs/`, `crates/`,
  `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `SECURITY.md`** — "compliant" /
  "certified" language → "-ready" + framework-specific qualifiers.
  Formal-verification claims (`"world's first/only"`, "136+ proofs")
  replaced with honest decomposition. Assertion-count claims
  removed; replaced with pointer to
  `docs/internals/testing/assertions-inventory.md`. VOPR scenario
  count corrected (74 enum variants, ~50 substantive, ~24
  scaffolded). "90-95% Antithesis-grade" replaced with
  "Antithesis-inspired deterministic simulation". Framework
  readiness percentages → "designed for / ready / no audit
  completed" framing. See
  `docs-internal/audit/2026-Q2-release-readiness.md` for the full
  18-item rubric.

### Fixed

- `install.sh` POSIX-sh local-variable collision inside
  `verify_checksum()` that caused `unzip` to look for the wrong
  filename. Helper-function locals renamed throughout. Mirror
  re-synced to `website/public/install.sh`.
- **Release publish workflow** — `cargo publish | tee` masking
  cargo failures fixed with `set -euo pipefail` + `PIPESTATUS[0]`;
  publish order expanded from 6 crates to full 24-crate topological
  order in 6 tiers with 30s settle delays; `kimberlite-doc-tests`
  marked `publish = false`.

---

## [0.4.1] — 2026-02-04

**Theme:** VOPR infrastructure hardening + formal verification
additions.

### Added

- **FCIS pattern adapters** in `crates/kimberlite-sim/src/adapters/`
  for Clock, RNG, Network, Storage, Crash. Trait-based abstraction
  for swapping sim ↔ production implementations.
- **19 specialised invariant checkers** — offset monotonicity,
  event-count bounds, consensus safety. O(1) checkers replace the
  O(n!) linearizability checker (which was a naive implementation
  that couldn't scale).
- **5 canary mutations** with 100% detection rate — proves VOPR
  catches real bugs.
- **17 fault-injection test scenarios.**
- **Docker release hotfix** — v0.4.1 bumps the Docker image tag
  without a workspace version bump.

### Performance

- Maintained >70k sims/sec throughput with the new invariant
  checkers (vs the prior O(n!) checker that was the bottleneck).

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-02-03

**Theme:** VOPR advanced debugging — production-grade DST platform.

### Added

- **Timeline visualisation** — ASCII Gantt chart renderer for
  understanding simulation execution flow. 11 event kinds
  (client ops, storage, network, protocol, crashes, invariants).
  `vopr timeline failure.kmb --width 120`.
- **Bisect to first bad event.** `BisectEngine` performs O(log n)
  binary search through the event sequence.
  `SimulationCheckpoint` + `CheckpointManager` with deterministic
  RNG fast-forward to any event. 10-100× faster than full replay;
  typical convergence <10 iterations for 100k events. Generates
  minimal reproduction bundles.
- **Delta debugging** — Zeller's ddmin algorithm for automatic
  test-case minimisation. Dependency-aware (network, storage,
  causality). 80-95% test-case reduction achieved.
- **Real kernel state hash** — BLAKE3 hashing of actual kernel
  state replaces the prior placeholder. Enables true determinism
  validation and checkpoint integrity.
- **Coverage dashboard** (`vopr dashboard`). Axum + Askama +
  Datastar web UI. 4 coverage dimensions (state points, message
  sequences, fault combinations, event sequences). Real-time SSE
  updates; top seeds table; progress bars.
- **Interactive TUI** (`vopr tui`). Ratatui-based terminal UI with
  3 tabs (Overview, Logs, Configuration), real-time progress
  gauge, scrollable logs.

### Changed

- CLI gains 5 new commands: `timeline`, `bisect`, `minimize`,
  `dashboard`, `tui`.
- Feature flags: `dashboard` (axum + askama + tokio-stream), `tui`
  (ratatui + crossterm).

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-02-03

**Theme:** VOPR VSR mode — protocol-level Byzantine testing.

### Added

- Complete VSR protocol integration into VOPR. Fundamental
  architecture shift from state-based simulation to testing actual
  VSR replicas processing real protocol messages with Byzantine
  mutation.
- **10 protocol-level attack patterns** in `protocol_attacks.rs`
  (SplitBrain, MaliciousLeader, PrepareEquivocation, ForgedMessage,
  ReplayOldPrepare, …) with 3 pre-configured suites (Standard,
  Aggressive, Subtle). 100% attack detection rate.
- **Event logging** with compact binary format (~100 bytes/event).
  `.kmb` reproduction bundles (bincode + zstd). Perfect
  reproduction from seed + event log.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-02-03

**Theme:** VSR hardening and Byzantine resistance.

### Added

- **Storage realism** — 4 I/O scheduler policies (FIFO, Random,
  Elevator, Deadline); concurrent out-of-order I/O (up to 32
  operations/device); 5 crash scenarios (DuringWrite, DuringFsync,
  PowerLoss, etc.); block-level granularity (4KB); torn-write
  simulation.
- **Byzantine-resistant VSR consensus** with production-enforced
  assertions in cryptography, consensus, and state-machine paths.
- **Realistic workload generators** — 6 patterns (Uniform, Hotspot,
  Sequential, MultiTenant, Bursty, ReadModifyWrite).
- **Coverage-guided fuzzing** with multi-dimensional coverage
  tracking and 3 selection strategies.

### Performance

- 85k-167k sims/sec throughput with full fault injection.
- Storage realism overhead: <5%. Event logging overhead: <10%.

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-02-02

**Theme:** advanced testing infrastructure + documentation.

### Added

- **VOPR framework** (Viewstamped Replication Operational Property
  testing) — deterministic simulation framework inspired by
  TigerBeetle + Antithesis.
- **Invariant checking** with production-ready documentation.
- **Comprehensive docs layout** — user-facing in `docs/`, internal
  in `docs-internal/`.

---

## [0.1.10] — 2026-01-31

**Theme:** protocol layer, SDK integration, secure data sharing.

### Added

- Complete **wire protocol** implementation (TCP + length-prefixed
  frames, JWT + API-key auth, TLS).
- **Multi-language SDKs** (Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go) with
  tests and CI.
- **SQL query engine** — SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE
  TABLE, aggregates, GROUP BY, HAVING, DISTINCT, INNER / LEFT
  JOIN, parameterised queries (`$1`, `$2`, ...).
- **Secure data-sharing layer** with consent ledger.
- **MCP server** for LLM integration (4 tools).

---

## [0.1.5] — 2026-01-25

**Theme:** RBAC, ABAC, masking, consent, erasure.

### Added

- **RBAC** with 4 roles, SQL rewriting, column filtering, row-level
  security.
- **ABAC** with 12 condition types, 3 pre-built compliance policies
  (HIPAA, FedRAMP, PCI DSS).
- **Field-level data masking** with 5 strategies (Redact, Hash,
  Tokenize, Truncate, Null).
- **Consent management** with 8 purposes, kernel-level enforcement.
- **Right to erasure** (GDPR Article 17) with 30-day deadlines and
  exemptions.
- **Breach detection** with 6 indicators and 72-hour notification
  deadlines.
- **Data portability export** (GDPR Article 20) with HMAC-SHA256
  signing.
- **Audit logging** with 13 action types across all compliance
  modules.

---

## [0.1.0] — 2025-12-20

**Theme:** core foundation — crypto, storage, consensus, projections.

### Added

- **Cryptographic primitives.** SHA-256 + BLAKE3 dual-hash
  (`HashPurpose` enum enforces compliance vs hot-path split).
  AES-256-GCM content encryption. Ed25519 signatures.
- **Append-only log storage** with CRC32 checksums, segment
  rotation (256MB), index WAL.
- **Pure functional kernel** (Functional Core / Imperative Shell).
  Commands → State + Effects; deterministic by construction.
- **VSR consensus** (Viewstamped Replication) adapted from
  TigerBeetle's architecture, extended with multi-tenant routing,
  clock synchronisation, and repair-budget policies.
- **B+tree projection store** with MVCC and SIEVE cache for
  derived-view queries.
- **Multi-tenant isolation** at placement and kernel level.

### Design principles

- **All data is an immutable ordered log; all state is a derived
  view.**
- **Functional Core / Imperative Shell** — kernel is pure, IO at
  the edges.
- **Make illegal states unrepresentable** — enums over booleans,
  newtypes over primitives.
- **Parse, don't validate** — validate at boundaries once, then
  use typed representations throughout.
