## Kimberlite-Specific Standards

In addition to the Contributor Covenant standards, Kimberlite community members are expected to:

- **Prioritize technical correctness** - Design discussions should focus on correctness, safety, and maintainability
- **Respect Kimberlite's core invariants** - Understand that some architectural decisions (immutable log, deterministic core, no unsafe code) are non-negotiable
- **Value clarity over cleverness** - Code should be readable and maintainable first
- **Engage constructively with Pressurecraft** - Our teaching-first philosophy means all code should be understandable

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**jared.reyes@kimberlite.dev**

For community discussion and support, join our Discord: https://discord.gg/QPChWYjD

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
